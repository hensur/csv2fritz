# csv2fritz
converts csv formatted contacts to fritzbox xml

This script was inspired by [gmail2fritz](https://github.com/mmanhertz/gmail2fritzbox) from [mmanhertz](https://github.com/mmanhertz/gmail2fritzbox)

It does somthing similiar: Converting a generic csv to the fritzbox contact xml format

This generic csv can be manually created and should contain these sections:
`["firstname", "lastname", "personal", "mobile", "work"]`

This csv can be generated by other tools, for example my [speedport-contacts-exporter](https://github.com/hensur/speedport-contacts-exporter)

The resulting xml can then be "restored" in a fritzbox (all existing contacts will be overwritten)

Usage:
`./csv2fritzbox input.csv export.xml`
